# TANELEER

This is just a simple example Ruby on Rails application that I used to learn Ruby on Rails and build sample deployments.  It models a simple book collection manager and is in no way intended to be a production application.

It was developed using the [official Ruby docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby), the [official PostgresQL docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).
